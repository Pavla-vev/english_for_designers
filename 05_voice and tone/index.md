# Voice and Tone
The tone of voice is how the character of me and my business comes through in my words, both written and spoken. Itâ€™s not about what I say, but rather the way I say it, and the impression it makes on everyone who reads or hears me.

## Voice
Sometimes it might not seem like it but I am a very shy and anxious person. I am usually very nervous when I have to present in public or speak with clients. To be perceived more confident and hide my nervousness I speak loud and clear.

## Tone
I always try to sound very friendly to lighten the mood. It is always easier for everyone present to feel welcomed and heard when they do not feel intimidated. Setting a friendly mood makes work, talking to clients, and presenting much easier for me and for them.
