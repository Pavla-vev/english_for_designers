## Zubní klinika

# About and problem

Zubní klinika is a dentist clinic based in Chomutov. They provide complex dental services under one roof. They needed to expand but the building was not providing enough space. They decided to buy other two buildings and connect them. The problem is that these buildings have very different layouts and styles. For visitors became quite difficult to navigate through the building and they were getting lost. My task was to unify the visual identity, create orientation systems of the building, and design a new website.
