## My Story

![Photo of me in a white shirt.](img/DSC_3588.jpg)

I started as an engineering student at a technical high school in Chomutov. I continued to study engineering at Czech Technical University, after successfully graduating. That seemed like a reasonable idea at first. But I quickly started to get better and earn money at something I started to do in my senior year of high school. That something was graphic design and I knew I have found my real passion. At that moment started my journey. I wanted to ditch engineering a study graphic design to get even better at it. But unfortunately, I was not accepted into UMPRUM and I slowly started to accept that I have to continue with engineering. Thankfully teachers here at VŠKK did not think I was useless and they accepted me.

Besides being a designer I am a drummer, lover of music, movies, animals, games, sports, and art. Drumming together with music was and still is a second passion of mine. I attended music school for 8 years since I was twelve. From that point, my love for music is growing each year more and more.
